## 💡 Ideas for Practical Implementation
1. Use Inverse Propensity Weighting to predict score for hired/not hired based on covariate features  
2. Use the Deconfounder to predict revenue (salary) given one candidate skills  
3. Measure how the introduction of a new features causes engagement in using the app (by measuring use time)
