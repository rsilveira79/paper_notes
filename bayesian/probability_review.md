## 1. Probability Models and Axioms

## 2. Conditional Probability and Bayes Rule


- Derive Bayes Rule from Conditional Probabilities  

Starting w/ cause-effect, given that A occured

$$P(B|A_{i}) = A_{i} \rightarrow B $$

and we want to do inference:  
$$P(A_{i}|B) = A_{i} \leftarrow B $$

Bayes rule answer philsofical question $$\rightarrow $$ how to learn from experience in systematic way $$\rightarrow $$ update beliefs
